A program that stores multiple messages which can be easily accessed and copied
to the clipboard to then be pasted easily as required

Step 1: Program Design and Data Structures

Use a dictionary with a key-phrase as the key and the associated message as value
The key-phrase will be a one word phrase that can be used to easily access the 
message

Our program will run as follows;
 using a command line argument that is a short key phrase the message associated
 with that key phrase will be copied to the clipboard so that the user can paste
 it as neccessary. This way, the user can have long, detailed messages without
 having to retype them

Step 2: Handle Command Line Arguments
Program should have 2 command-line arguments - the first is the program name and 
the second is the phrase which is the key to the text we want copied to clipboard
Display a message if user forgets to add phrase i.e if the command line arguments
are less than 2, otherwise assign the second command line argument to a variable

Step 3: Copy the Right Phrase
Using the variable that stores the second command line argument, if it exists as
a key in the dictionary, copy it to the clipboard and notify user. If not, display useful message
